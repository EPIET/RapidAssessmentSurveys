R packages are bundles of functions which extend the capability of R. Thousands of add-on packages are available in the main online repository (known as CRAN) and many more packages in development can be found on GitHub. They may be installed and updated over the Internet.

We will mainly use packages which come ready installed with R (base code), but where it makes things easier we will use add-on packages. In addition, we have included a few extra functions to simplify the code required. All the R packages you need for the exercises can be installed over the Internet.

```{r, eval=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Installing required packages for the week
required_packages <- c("foreign", "broom", "leaps", "survey")

install.packages(required_packages)
```

```{r, echo = F, eval=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Installing required packages for the week
required_packages <- c("foreign", "broom", "leaps", "survey", "knitr")

install.packages(required_packages)
```

Run the following code at the beginning of the caset study to make sure that you have made available all the packages and functions that you need. Be sure to include it in any scripts too.

```{r, eval = F, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading required packages for the week
required_packages <- c("foreign", "broom", "leaps", "survey")

for (i in seq(along = required_packages))
  library(required_packages[i], character.only = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=F, eval= TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading required packages for the week
required_packages <- c("foreign", "broom", "leaps", "survey", "knitr")

for (i in seq(along = required_packages))
  library(required_packages[i], character.only = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Function to make tables with counts and proportions 
big.table <- function(data) {
  count <- table(data)
  prop <- round(prop.table(count)*100, digits = 2)
  cbind(count,
        prop) 
}

```

R and Stata have minor differences in default settings and methods. In this document we will follow the Stata analysis as closely as possible, but small and usually unimportant differences may be noted between the statistical findings in R and those in Stata. At some points additional steps (which would usually be optional in R) will be taken to produce output which is comparable to that of Stata.

The big.table function uses data directly and combines counts and proportions, thus reducing the number of lines of code required for descriptive analyses.  

You will work with Stata.dta data sets which can be loaded into R with the "foreign" or "readstata13" packages. The appropriate functions to use will be indicated.

R can hold one or many data sets in memory simultaneously, so there is usually no need to save intermediate files or close and re-open datasets.


# Session 6 - Multivariable analysis

Start a new R script, name it, for example, **session6.r** and save it in your working directory. Write all commands in the R script so that you can run (and re-run) it when needed during the exercise.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
setwd("N:/MED/IMED-VIE/INFE/Public/CC-INFE-Schmid/EPIET/Learning R/R Case studies/RAS 2017/session 4")

```

Open the **vaccine6.dta** dataset  
```{r}
vacc <- read.dta("vaccine6.dta", convert.factors = FALSE)
```

## Task 6.1 Logistic regression
#### Treat minority as a categorical variable and change the reference group
As seen in the MVA module, for logit and logistic regression, we use glm with a "logit" link. We obtain ORs by exponentiating the output of the logit model.  Minority is treated as a factor variable in the model by writing **factor** before the variable.

```{r}
model <- glm(vacful~factor(minority),
              data = vacc,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"))

modelop <- tidy(model, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(modelop, digits = 5) 
```

The level of reference for minority is set to **0** by R.  
```{r}
# Here, we see the 4 levels of minority
big.table(vacc$minority)
```


We can change the reference level of minority in a number of ways. See below for an example.  
```{r}
# Create a new variable where the reference is the 4th level of the minority variable
vacc$minority2 <- relevel(factor(vacc$minority), ref = 4)
```


#### Use the anova test to see if independent variables (e.g. minority groups (minority), gender (gender), other siblings in the family (osibling)  contribute significantly to the model. 

If we want to compare two models, we will use the **anova** test, which tests for the difference in the residual deviances between the models. This is equivalent to the likelihood ratio test in Stata. An important point when comparing two models is that they should both contain the same number of observations. 


First run a model with the outcome (vacful) and three independent variables (minority, osibling and gender).  
```{r}
# Note use of the minority2 variable here 
model2 <- glm(vacful~factor(minority2) + osibling + gender,
              data = vacc,
              family = binomial(link = "logit"))

model2op <- tidy(model2, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)

# Number of observations in the model:  
nobs(model2)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(model2op, digits = 5)
```


Then, we run a reduced model (removing one of the independent variables, e.g. gender).  The reduced model (i.e. the model without the dropped variable) will contain more observations than the full model (model2). To overcome this, we subset our dataset so that it has the same number of observations as in model2. See [here](https://theesspreckelsen.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/estimation-sample-information-from-linear-regression-in-r-using-lm-aka-statas-esample/) for more information.

```{r}
# This creates a matrix out of the residuals of each observation of model2
esample <- rownames(as.matrix(resid(model2)))

# We then subset the vacc dataset with esample to have the same number of observations as model2
model3 <- glm(vacful~factor(minority2) + osibling,
              data = vacc[esample,],
              family = binomial(link = "logit"))

model3op <- tidy(model3, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)

# Number of observations in the model:  
nobs(model3)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(model3op, digits = 5)
```


Finally, perform the anova test to compare the 2 models. 
```{r}
anova(model2, model3, test = "Chisq")
```

The p-value of 0.8208 suggests that the 2 models are not significantly different (p-value > 0.05). So, we can drop the variable gender, as it does not contribute significantly to the model and keep the simpler (reduced) model with only minority and osibling as the independent variables.



#### Perform logistic regression using the weights and allowing for the clustering, using the command svyglm and regTermTest to perform Wald tests.

The logistic regression you have done so far ignores the sampling weights and the clustering in the sample. To allow for the weights and the clustering you can use the svyglm command in R. However, if you use weights and/or allow for the clustering any anova test will be invalid. In this case, you just have to use the approximate significance Wald tests that R gives in the regression table. Alternatively, to test variables with more than one parameter after the regression (svyglm), you can use **regTermTest**. This provides Wald test and working likelihood ratio (Rao-Scott) test of the hypothesis that all coefficients associated with a particular regression term are zero (or have some other specified values).

The use of the **quasibinomial** family with svyglm is recommended rather than binomial in order to avoid obtaining the error message about non-integer numbers of successes. The "quasi" versions of the family objects give the same point estimates and standard errors and do not give the warning.

For example:

```{r}
# First,set the design to include clustering, stratification and weights
design <- svydesign(ids = ~school, weights = ~weight, strata = ~strata, data = vacc)

model4 <- svyglm(vacful~factor(minority2) + factor(osibling) + factor(mageg) + factor(educf),
                 data = vacc,
                 family = quasibinomial(link = "logit"),
                 design = design)

model4op <- tidy(model4, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T)
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(model4op, digits = 5)
```

Now assess those categorical variables using regTermTest.  

```{r}
regTermTest(model4, "factor(minority2)")
```

The p-value suggests that **minority** contributes significantly to the model and cannot be dropped.  

```{r}
regTermTest(model4, "factor(osibling)")

regTermTest(model4, "factor(mageg)")

regTermTest(model4, "factor(educf)")
```


#### Work your way towards a final model (the simplest adequate model). Include in your initial model all the variables of Table 5.2 (session 5). Use vacful as the outcome variable.


Your final model should look like this:   

```{r}
finalmodel <- svyglm(vacful~factor(minority2) + factor(osibling) + factor(mageg) + a1x5g + a3x1g,
                     data = vacc,
                     family = quasibinomial(link = "logit"),
                     design = design)

finalmodelop <- tidy(finalmodel, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(finalmodelop, digits = 5)
```


## Task 6.2 Binomial regression

#### Generalised linear model to estimate relative risks using sampling weights  
The measure of effect of choice in this study was PR and not OR. To estimate adjusted PR and using sampling weights, you should use a generalized linear model (with a log link function). You may use the svglm command with log link and vacful as the outcome variable.  

```{r}
# Use the previously defined final model
bin1 <- svyglm(vacful~factor(minority2) + factor(osibling) + factor(mageg) + a1x5g + a3x1g,
               data = vacc,
               family = quasibinomial(link = "log"),
               design = design)

bin1op <- tidy(bin1, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(bin1op, digits = 5)
```

The completed table 6.2 should look like this:

# Conclusions

* **Summarising the results**
  
  This study identified several independent determinants of complete and age-appropriate vaccination status among 6-year old school children in Greece. Both complete and age-appropriate vaccination coverage were significantly lower among children who belonged to a minority group, who had siblings in the household and whose parents/guardians perceived long distance to the place of immunization as a barrier to vaccination. In addition, maternal age <30 years and the perception that natural disease is preferable to vaccination were significantly associated with lower rates of complete vaccination. Furthermore, low paternal education was an additional predictor of delayed vaccination. These findings indicate that socioeconomic factors may be more important determinants of immunization coverage than parental perceptions. 
  
* **Recommendations**

* Based on the findings of this study, the following identified groups merit increased attention in future interventions designed to improve immunization delivery in Greece:  
    + minority groups, especially Roma and immigrants,  
    + families with many children,  
    + young mothers, and   
    + households headed by fathers with low educational level, possible reflecting low socioeconomic status of the families.  

* Interventions aimed at those high-risk families, although difficult to deliver, may have the greatest effects on community immunization rates. 

* In addition, parents/guardians must be educated about the hazards of diseases that vaccinations prevent and the likely susceptibility of their children to these diseases. 

* There is a need for policies to overcome structural and health care system barriers to immunization, and identify effective and comprehensive approaches for improving the immunization levels of children in high-risk groups.
