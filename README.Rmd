## Overview

This [repository](https://github.com/EPIET/RapidAssessmentSurveys) hosts the R learning materials for the EPIET Rapid Assessments and Surveys (RAS) module.  In particular, you will find the R case study guide and associated materials for conducting survey analysis on vaccination coverage data from Greece.

Credits go to the original authors of the case study, as well as the contributors who subsequently created and adapted the R companion guide (see version history in the guide for the list of authors and contributors).  The guide is reviewed and updated annually.

This case study is covered by a Gnu General Public Licence version 3 (GPL-3).  Please read the [licence conditions](https://github.com/EPIET/RapidAssessmentSurveys/blob/master/LICENSE) before using or distributing this case study.

To follow this case study, you will first need the participant pack, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/EPIET/RapidAssessmentSurveys/raw/master/2022_dplyr_version/RAS_VCE_participant_pack.zip).  

You can then access the R guide for this case study in two ways:

- Click on [this link](https://epiet.github.io/RapidAssessmentSurveys/RAS_VCE_R_guide_2022.html) to open the guide online in your internet browser (internet connection required)
- The guide is also available in HTML, Microsoft Word and .pdf format in the `guide` folder of the participant pack

We recommend you use the HTML version of this guide (either online or off-line) as it is easier to navigate between the sections, however if you prefer, you can also print out the .pdf or Microsoft Word versions.


Comments and suggestions are welcome.  If you have found a bug in the case study code, please raise an issue about it [here](https://github.com/EPIET/RapidAssessmentSurveys/issues), clearly stating the nature of the problem and providing a reproducible example. You can also use the **issues** page to suggest new features or topics to cover in a future version.
